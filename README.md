# 🚨 AI Critical Minutes – Emergency Risk Detection System

AI Critical Minutes is an **AI-powered emergency risk detection system** designed to assist during the **golden critical minutes** of a medical emergency.  
Instead of predicting specific diseases, the system detects **physiological instability** using vital signs and provides **actionable guidance (Do’s & Don’ts)** in real time.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

In sudden emergencies such as dizziness, collapse, breathing difficulty,attacks, patients and people around patient often lose valuable time deciding **what to do or what to not do immediately**.  
Raw predictions or medical terms are not helpful in such moments.

This project focuses on:
- **Early risk detection**
- **Clear emergency severity**
- **Immediate, understandable actions**

---

## 💡 Key Idea

> **Risk detection over disease prediction**

The system evaluates multiple vital signs together to assess:
- Normal
- Warning
- High Emergency  

It then converts this risk into **human-readable emergency guidance**.
